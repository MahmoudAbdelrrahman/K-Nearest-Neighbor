# K-Nearest-Neighbor
Use provided train and test file. Each record in dataset contain feature values are separated by  commas, and the last value on each line is the class label 1. Implement your own simple KNN classifier 2. Use Euclidean distance to compute distances between instances. 3. Apply KNN for k=1,3,5,7,9 4. As output, your programs should print the value of k used for the test set followed by  the number of correctly classified test instances, and the total number of instances in the  test set &amp;Accuracy. Example: - Number of correctly classified instances: 238 Total number of instances : 445  Accuracy : 0.5348314606741573
